# Tiled-Matrix-Multiplication

This project aims to implement a tiled matrix multiplication kernel that can support arbitrary-sized matrices. You can find the detailed description of the project [here](http://teaching.danielwong.org/csee217/fall21/lab3-matrixmultiplication). The report of the project is [here](https://github.com/mahbod-art/Tiled-Matrix-Multiplication/blob/main/report.pdf).
